      <h4>Video games have become one of the most popular entertainment and profitable industries in
        China in the past two decades. China has the world's largest number of esports players and has
        become the largest esports consumer market in the world. According to research, there are 552
        million Chinese video game players in 2022(Lai Lin Thomala, 2023). Also, the revenue of
        Chinese esports continues to increase from 2014 to 2019. Chinese esports is rapidly developing
        with a huge compound growth rate of 132.2% and reaching RMB 102.8 billion in revenues by
        2019(Yang Yue et al., 2020). This industry develops rapidly and promotes within a short time so
        it is valuable for people to analyze. I argue that support from the Chinese government,
        technological innovation, and the appearance of live streaming are three primary factors that
        account for the rapid development of the video game industry in China in recent years.
        Supportive policies from the Chinese government encourage more people to engage in this field
        and build video game organizations or clubs. Also, the development of new technology
        contributes to a new genre of video games named mobile gaming. It attracts a lot of new players
        and is more convenient than traditional console games. Besides, live streaming creates job
        opportunities for players and increases the popularity of many video games. Finally, I will
        discuss and mention other essential elements such as the usage of social media and the influence
        of globalization, which boost the rapid development of the Chinese video game industry as well.
        In the past two decades, the video game industry in China developed so fast from a small-scale
        industry to a giant field. It is worth analyzing how this industry changes and its development
        strategies. Many high-tech companies, investment companies, and companies from different
        fields look forward to finding out its development secrets. In this paper, I make use of secondary
        research to collect information, evidence, and databases to demonstrate my viewpoints and
        answer my research question</h4>
