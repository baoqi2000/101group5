            <h1><b>Marine Life Endangerment</b></h1>
            <p>The Marine Biology Conservations Society reports that the most common causes for marine life
                endangerment are loss of habitat, spread of disease, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices.
                These each directly impact species that inhabit small, specific environments, such as the zebra shark
                that inhabit coral reefs off the Australian coast. Threats that plague marine life are difficult to perceive
                due to the difficulty of perception in comparison to the visibility of land animals.

                <p>Hello everyone! My name is Alejandro Hernandez and I'm a 3rd year AGPM student, but I've been heavily interested in marine life
                    since I was a little kid! This page is just to inform you on a few marine species that are currently facing heavy threats to their
                    endangerment level.

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p>The Vaquita Porpoise is known as the world's rarest marine animal with only about 10 individuals inhabiting
                            the Gulf of California in Mexico, their native habitat. This species of porpoise was only recently discovered
                            in 1958 and their population has only decreased due to them being caught and drowned in gill nets used by illegal
                            fishing operations.

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p>The Hawksbill Turtle is another marine species that is currently on the critically endangered list. Named for their narrow, 
                    pointed beak while also having an overlapping pattern on their shell, giving their scales a serrated look. Originally 
                    inhabiting the tropical waters found near coral reefs, these turtles are being sold for their distinctive shell pattern known 
                    as a "tortoise shell". Their decreasing numbers are worrying for multiple reasons, but specifically for their link to marine 
                    ecosystem health with their contributions toward keeping coral reefs and sea grass beds healthy through their grazing.

            <div class="w3-container">
                <p>While not critically endangered, the zebra shark's decreasing numbers may signal deeper issues within Australia's coral reefs.
                    These sharks tend to stay in shallow waters foraging and hunting for small fish, snails, sea urchins, and crabs. They have also 
                    been observed resting on the ocean floor facing the current, having the water pump through their gills allowing them to breathe 
                    while they lay down on the floor. They have also been seen "surfing" on the floor, adjusting their fins to adapt to the change in 
                    current while also letting them remain still. These gentle giants' biggest threat are humans poaching and hunting them to be sold for
                    their fins, which are a delicacy in many different countries.
