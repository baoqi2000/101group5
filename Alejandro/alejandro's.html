            <h2>Marine Life Endangerment</h2>
            <p>The Marino Biology Conservation Society reports that the most common causes for marine life endangerment are
                loss of habitat, spread of disease, pollution, and unsustainable fishing practices. These each directly impact species
                that inhabit small, specific environments, such as the zebra shark that inhabit coral reefs off the Australian coast.
                Threats that plague marine life are difficult to perceive due to the difficulty with perception in comparison to the
                visibility of land animals.</p>

            <h2>Critically Endangered Species</h2>
            <h2>Vaquita Porpoise</h2>
            <p>The Vaquita is known as the worlds rarest marine mammal with only about 10 individuals inhabiting the Gulf of California
                in Mexico, their native habitat. This species of porpoise was only recently discovered in 1958 and their population has only
                decreased due to them being caught and drowned in gillnets used by illegal fishing operations.</p>

            <h2>Critically Endangered Species</h2>
            <h2>Hawksbill Turtle</h2>   
            <p>The Hawksbill Turtles are another marine species that are currently on the critically endangered list. Named for their narrow, 
                pointed beak while also having an overlapping pattern on their shell, giving their scales a serrated look. Originally inhabiting
                the tropical waters of coral reefs, these turtles are being sold for their distinctive shell pattern known as a "tortoiseshell".
                Their decreasing numbers are worrying for a number of reasons, but especially for their link to marine ecosystem health with their
                contributions towards keeping coral reefs and sea grass beds healthy.</p>

            <h2>Endangered</h2>
            <h2>Zebra Shark</h2>    
            <p>While not critically endangered, the zebra shark's decreasing numbers signal a deeper issue within the Australian coral reefs.
                These sharks tend to stay in shallow waters foraging and hunting for small fish, snails, sea urchins, and crabs. They have also
                been observed resting on the ocean floor facing the current, having the water pump through their gills allowing them to breathe
                while they lay down on the floor. They have also been seen surfing on the floor, adjusting fins to adapt to the change in current
                while also letting them remain still. These gentle giants' biggest threat are humans poaching and hunting them to be sold for their
                fins as well as a delicacy in many different countries.</p>

            <h2>Loopholes and Issues</h2>
            <p>While smaller corals, invertabrates, and fish are crucial to a healthty, functioning ecosystem, data on many of these smaller species
                are very difficult to collect due to the niche areas they inhabit that have proved difficult to reach and many of their sizes being 
                less than a millimeter at times. At times the preservation of a single animal can also mean the preservation of entire ecosystems and
                cultures at times. The preservation of the perciform darter was being threatened by the construction of a dam in Tennessee in the 1970s.
                The construction of this dam also threatened the existence of teh few remaining wild rivers in Tennesee, sacred Native American land, as
                well as important farmland. The Endangered Species Act was able to successfully block the construction of this dam due to it threatening
                the preservation efforts of the perciform darter. Situations such as these often make species preservation about more than just the species.
